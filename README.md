# Tic Tac Toe 2 Player Game

This project is my contribution to the [Flutter Create contest](https://flutter.dev/create).

The goal is to write an app with 5KB or less of Dart code.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you need two devices, a "server" and a "client".

First, run the server version. To do that set the `ip` on [line 100](https://github.com/the4thfloor/flutter_create/blob/master/lib/main.dart#L100) to `null`.

After that run the client version. To do that set the `ip` on [line 100](https://github.com/the4thfloor/flutter_create/blob/master/lib/main.dart#L100) to the IP address of the server device.

## Play the game

On one device click the `New Game` button. The player who clicks the button is player 1 and has the first move.
